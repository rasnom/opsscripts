Natural light fills the dramatic living room and dining room leading into a fresh, colorful, open kitchen with all high-end appliances. A new redwood deck and private patio with a mature maple provide a perfect fall entertainment venue. Two generous-sized bedrooms, full bath, and lofty office space occupy the upper split-level. A recently redone lower level has an option for a master bedroom suite with full bath or family room.

A magical home set back from the street, framed by a court yard, surrounded by lush gardens, level lawn, patio and park-like backyard that goes well beyond the fence. Lovely sunlit living room with barreled ceilings and two sets of French doors that open to private front and rear patios. Spacious kitchen has been lovingly updated, with a large stone island, pretty eating area adjacent to a family room that opens through French doors to the patio and garden. Upstairs are two generous bedrooms, a smaller bedroom that works well as an office or nursery, one updated bath with radiant heat. There is a perfect spot to add a second bath to the larger back bedroom that overlooks the backyard. Charmed Crocker Highlands location within minutes of the Transbay bus to SF, Crocker Highlands Elementary and conveniently located to Lakeshore and Grand Ave.","twitter:image":"https://ap.rdcpix.com/84595941/bb7f4b6214e607730d0a22f58a968c19l-m0xd-w640_h480_q80.jpg"}],"cse_image":[{"src":"https://ap.rdcpix.com/84595941/bb7f4b6214e607730d0a22f58a968c19l-m0xd-w640_h480_q80.jpg"}],"thing":[{"name":"California"},{"name":"Alameda County"},{"name":"Oakland"},{"name":"Trestle-Glen Rd"}],"geocoordinates":[{"latitude":"37.809368","longitude":"-122.226407"},{"latitude":"37.811259","longitude":"-122.222603"},{"latitude":"37.811458","longitude":"-122.222402"},{"latitude":"37.808851","longitude":"-122.23972"},{"latitude":"37.809479","longitude":"-122.240621"},{"latitude":"37.81341","longitude":"-122.221209"},{"latitude":"37.810811","longitude":"-122.223203"},{"latitude":"37.810032","longitude":"-122.22548"},{"latitude":"37.808064","longitude":"-122.239192"},{"latitude":"37.807488","longitude":"-122.237953"},{"latitude":"37.806717","longitude":"-122.233534"},{"latitude":"37.807212","longitude":"-122.233403"},{"latitude":"37.807495","longitude":"-122.236049"},{"latitude":"37.80691","longitude":"-122.236448"},{"latitude":"37.80814","longitude":"-122.227193"},{"latitude":"37.808399","longitude":"-122.226886"},{"latitude":"37.80876","longitude":"-122.226376"},{"latitude":"37.809148","longitude":"-122.225708"},{"latitude":"37.809827","longitude":"-122.224497"},{"latitude":"37.807056","longitude":"-122.232054"},{"latitude":"37.807273","longitude":"-122.229495"},{"latitude":"37.809327","longitude":"-122.233313"},{"latitude":"37.820058","longitude":"-122.235976"},{"latitude":"37.802931","longitude":"-122.239701"},{"latitude":"37.808196","longitude":"-122.24562"},{"latitude":"37.814147","longitude":"-122.226982"}],"hproduct":[{"description":"3 beds 1 full, 1 half baths 2,085 sq ft 0.24 acres lot","fn":"1255 Trestle Glen Rd, Oakland, CA 94610","photo":"https://ap.rdcpix.com/84595941/bb7f4b6214e607730d0a22f58a968c19l-m0xd-w640_h480_q80.jpg","currency":"USD","currency_iso4217":"840"}],"listitem":[{"position":"1"},{"position":"2"},{"position":"3"},{"position":"4"}]},"snippet":"Browse photos and price history of this 3 bed, 2 bath, 2085 Sq.
