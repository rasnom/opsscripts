Because the front of the house sets the tone for the rest of the property, it was important that the area reflect their love of clean, simple lines and modern elegance.  Wanting to maintain privacy for the courtyard but also add visual interest, they decided on a new design that includes two layers of staggered horizontal ipe boards set an inch apart.  A custom stainless steel support inside the courtyard was added for the heaviest limb to keep the tree from creating pressure on the top of the fence.  A steel-frame, laminated and tempered clear glass awning - held up by cables on both sides - was added above the front door to give the home a more visible entry.  A combination of low-voltage up lights along the front ipe wood fence, lights along the stairs and a fixture at the front door illuminate the courtyard area.  The lights we used were tailored to the nature of the space.
