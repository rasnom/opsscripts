Then there's the widely held view that the sink, refrigerator and range should be arranged as a triangle.                  For Dona Savitsky, though, the driving principle behind her recent kitchen renovation could be summed up as: Let there be more light.                  In a house that totals roughly 800 square feet, and with a tight budget at play, lavish expenditures were rarely considered. The location of the existing pipes, for example, meant a triangular configuration for the appliances was not an option.","og:type":"article","og:url":"http://www.sfchronicle.com/homeandgarden/article/Chef-s-kitchen-adds-light-flow-to-entire-6431228.php","og:image":"http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/63/35/8337245/13/rawImage.jpg","og:site_name":"San Francisco Chronicle","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","twitter:site":"@sfchronicle","fb:app_id":"537896802938133","article:content_tier":"metered","vf:unique_id":"premiumsfgate-article-6431228","vf:section":"foodandhome","__sync_contentcategory":"meterA"}],"cse_image":[{"src":"http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/63/35/8337245/13/rawImage.jpg"}]},"snippet":"Aug 7, 2015 ... “At the restaurant, you'll be working at your prep table and have shelves above \nyou filled with your sugar, salt, pepper, spices, oils.

For the last four years, Jonah Rhodehamel has been in charge of the kitchen, carrying on the legacy of making pasta and focusing on a whole-animal menu.  In 2014, the restaurant underwent its first major renovation in 18 years, and owners Maggie and Bob Klein brought in Meyer Sound to orchestrate an appropriate noise level.  There’s an exciting buzz to the room, yet it’s easy to have a conversation, thanks to the system of microphones and electronics in the ceiling that manages the noise level.  On my most recent visit, main courses started at $26 for a vegetarian option; most meat and fish items are now more than $30.  The best part of the dinner were the appetizers: a pristine mixed chicory salad ($13) with a sweet balsamic vinaigrette balanced with Gorgonzola cheese, hazelnuts and Asian pears.

The house is still cute and charming, but the surrounding neighborhood known as San Antonio Park that has long been known for high crime rates has changed.  Truong says this house is located a block from 20th Avenue, where an area that was once called the \"Murder Dubs\" starts and continues until 29th Avenue.  Truong says that as families are priced out of other Oakland neighborhoods such as Rockridge where starter homes are selling for well over a million dollars, they're beginning to look east of Lake Merritt.  The four-bedroom, two-bath still has many of its original charms including a gingerbread façade, hardwood floors and an upstairs open parlor overlooking the estuary, the bay and San Francisco.","og:type":"article","og:url":"http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/East-Oakland-real-estate-1726-19th-Ave-Victorian-11213464.php","og:image":"http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/61/67/35/13072204/3/rawImage.jpg","og:site_name":"SFGate","twitter:card":"summary_large_image","twitter:site":"@SFGate","twitter:creator":"@search?q=%40bayareamoms&src=typd","fb:admins":"100006394927810","fb:app_id":"1609422252616351","fb:pages":"105702905593,307851324523,12852567813,480760515417232,288240529145,316774245761,984197758297116,7457442370,207033189701,207346283795,222959748728,207042068180,72983690774,339413234035,343689323559,345828366626,234821559861394,335699426867,10150105039485602,338983127562,364516539001,337922332042,115637335153191,372011535931,333376634908,127590790608884,141923885872653,655037391286291,320774811368833,1740489152861748,469700473093040,386754203367,556449374478585,340999853450,350771491032,1120648627959218,342017778245,338463361591,138772706196968,1641688532739111,326312697536,353120110016,343366744658,335009494554,347261603104,350924013892,257724773860,361203926417,367174215398,284154645394,334501182354,350279743224,154340691263654,147848678611852","msvalidate.01":"9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7"}],"cse_image":[{"src":"http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/61/67/35/13072204/3/rawImage.jpg"}]},"snippet":"Jun 13, 2017 ...
