This material has many advantages, including being virtually maintenance-free. There will be differences in the quality of one manufacturer's vinyl compared to another.

For example, titanium dioxide makes the vinyl more heat resistant. At first glance, competing windows may look the same, but there can be key differences in the vinyl recipe used and how vinyl parts are formed to make a window structurally strong and optimize insulation performance.
